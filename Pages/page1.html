                <h3>Beginner Guide</h3>
                <h5 class="date-opacity">Setptember 21, 2023</h5>
                <p class="intro">Want to learn how to fish? Here is a quick step-to-step guide that I recommend to start your fishing adventures.
                </p>
                <p class="artical-name">Step 1: Buying Fishing Gear<br>
                    <span class="artical">Before going out on the water, you need to buy fishing gear. All you need is a a fishing rod and a spinning reel, the best part is that both could be bought together as a combo deal for about 20 bucks! <br> Also buy a spool of monofilament fishing line (6- or 8-pound test), a couple of split shot sinkers (BB size) and some hooks (size 2 for small bait, up to size 3/0 for bigger bait.)</span>
                </p>

                <p class="artical-name">Step 2: Gear Setup<br>
                   <span class="artical">Now that you have all the gear you need, its time to setup your rod by spooling your reel with the fishing line. The way to spool a reel is you run the fishing line through the circle guides, after that you lift up the bail and tie the line on the spool with two overhand knot. Finally close the bail and start reeling the line while keeping tension so the line could go on evenlly. Once you fill the reel keep the line through all the guides and at the end of you line add a hook that is half the size of your bait.  </span>
                </p>

                <p class="artical-name"> Step 3: Getting Bait<br>
                    <span class="artical"> Now its time to get bait example crickets, redworms, night crawlers, and minnows which can be bought as well in bait shops. But if you want to fun experience and add to your own adventure, try CATCHING YOUR OWN! Try looking around the area you plan to fish at or around your house where you think bugs would be, some places could be under stream rocks, logs, or leaf litters to find worms and crayfish. Dip nets could also be used to catch minnows in creeks and streams. </span>
                </p>

                <p class="artical-name"> Step 4: Finding A Fishing Spot<br>
                    <span class="artical">Finding a fishing spot varies in your area. The spots you are looking for are ponds, creeks, and lakes. Any of those body of water should contain multiple bass or bluegills. Once you find the spot get one of your baits and hook it on. After that cast it out into the middle or near structer that fish hide near.</span>
                </p>

                <p class="artical-name"> Step 5: Being Patient<br>
                    <span class="artical">Wait for a fish to bite the bait you casted out. PATIENTS IS KEY! it is possible for the fish to take sevrel minutes to find your bait. Remember to check the bait every few minutes to see if you still have bait on the hook.</span>
                </p>

                <p class="artical-name"> Step 6: Setting The Hook<br>
                    <span class="artical">Setting the hook is the decision maker if the fish stays on the hook. The way to set a hook is by quickly raising the rod up keeping the tip of the rod pointing up. Remember to reel in the line and keep tension keeping the fish to spit the hook out.</span>
                </p>

                <p class="artical-name"> Step 7: Handeling Fish<br>
                    <span class="artical">Fresh water fish you'll catch have spiny fins and a sand paper texture mouth. Its common to grab a fish from the mouth unless they have sharp teeth. If you dont feel comfortable grabbing it from the mouth, push the top fin back twords the tail and grab it from the head gently but firm.</span>
                </p>

                <p class="artical-name"> Step 8: Keep Or Release<br>
                    <span class="artical">Finally you cought a fish! Now its time to decide if you want to keep it or not. If you dont keep it take the hook out if its mouth and gently release it back into the water. </span>
