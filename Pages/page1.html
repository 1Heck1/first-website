                <h1>Top 3 Video Games</h1>
                <p>Welcome, I will be listing video games I enjoyed this year.</p>

                  <h2>1. Valheim</h2>
                  <p>Valheim is the first game to that made me think how games are actually made. With that being said valheim is the best when it comes to survival based games. This games could be played for hours a day and you would still have plenty to keep doing to level up your skills. From planning your next adventure or farming matirales to upgrade your wepons everything about this games makes it perfect to beat multiple times with friends or just solo.</p>

                  <h2>2. Sons Of The Forest</h2>
                  <p>Just because this is another open world survival game in this list doesnt mean this game is any less addictive. Sons of the forest scratches an ithch that no other game can do. It has a satisfying story to play, and the way wepons are obtained is so rewarding. This game also provides npcs which makes it possiable to play solo </p>

                  <h2>3. Apex Legends</h2>
                  <p>With apex being out for almost 3 years, it has to be the best battle royal game today. Apex is a free to play game but dont let that deceive your expectation. This game has one of the best user experience that beat other over priced games. From the guns down to the legends everything feels amazing for the price of a free game.</p>
